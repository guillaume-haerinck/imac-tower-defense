# Imac Tower Defense

An OpenGL 4.4 game made with Entity-Component-System design pattern. A gameplay video is [visible here](https://vimeo.com/892983458).

This is a student project for the French engineering school [IMAC](https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/). If you're a french-speaker, you might consider to have a look at the [post-mortem](https://github.com/guillaume-haerinck/imac-tower-defense/blob/master/doc/rapport.md) (it has a lot of images) inside the `doc` folder.

## Getting Started

You can play the game directly if you download the [executable here](https://github.com/guillaume-haerinck/imac-tower-defense/releases/tag/1.0) (windows only).

### Prerequisites

You must install **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)** and a C++ compiler which handles **C++ 14**. More on the compiler on the next sections.

The project need your graphic card driver to be up to date, as it is using **OpenGL 4.4** core profile (released in 2013, so it should be fine).

#### Linux

The recommended compiler is g++, minimum version required is `g++ 6.1`, which is included by default on many linux distribution. You can update it with :

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

You will also need the OpenGl and SDL2 packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev
```

#### Windows

The recommended compiler is MSVC. To install it you will need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/) (which is not VSCode) and select the C++ development package during installation. The [MingW](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler will work as well if you prefer to use it.

### Build

The `CMakeLists.txt` file ensure that the project will work on Linux and Windows platforms.

You can build and launch the project in many different ways, we covered a few of them :

#### `Option 1: Bash (Linux only)`

Go to this folder with a terminal, and enter those commands.

```bash
cmake .
make
./bin/imac-tower-defense
```

It means that you are genererating a Makefile, then using it to build the project, and finally running the binaries from the current working directory (needed to find assets).

#### `Option 2: Visual Studio (Windows only)`

From Visual Studio 2017, you don't need to generate a visual studio project with cmake. You can simply open visual studio, browse the toolbar to *File->Open->Cmake...* and select the `CMakeLists.txt` at the root of this directory. From this point, you have to make sure that you are using a **x86 build configuration**, and running the **imac-tower-defense target**. If everything is done, simply press `f5` or click on the green arrow at the top.

If you add files, you will need to re-generate the cache for a successfull build. To do so, right click on `CMakeLists.txt` and use `Generate Cache for imac-tower-defense`

![Screenshot](doc/readme-img/vs-studio-cache.png?raw=true "VS cache")

#### `Option 3: VSCode`

You will need the `CMakeTools` extension from vector-of-bools. If you want to change the source code, I highly recommend using the `C/C++` extension from Microsoft and the `CMake` extension from twxs.

![Screenshot](doc/readme-img/vs-code-extensions.png?raw=true "VSCode extensions")

From this point, when you will open the repository folder with VSCode, it will prompt you to configure the projet. You must select a x86 kit, for exemple the `Visual Studio Community 2017 - x86` kit. Once the configuration is done, you can compile the project by pressing `f7`. The .exe file will be outputed in `build/Debug` folder. You can launch it by pressing `f5`, but make sure to pick your operating system.

### Launch

Before launching the compiled binaries, **make sure that the working directory is set to this folder**, or the shaders files and images will not be found by the program. If you are unsure about how to do it, just copy the builded files to this folder before launching them. (by default, they will be in the `bin/Debug` folder).

## Documentation

### Philosophy

The project follows the **Entity Component System** design pattern. It has been made possible with the great [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) library.

Our game is concieved as a state machine, and works like this architecture :
